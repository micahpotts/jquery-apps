//Problem - looks bad in small browsers and devices
//Solution - hide text links and swap them for smaller nav

//create a selecct and append to menu
//cycle over menu links
	//create an option
	//option's value is href of the link
	//option text is text of the link
	//append option to select
//create button
//bind click to button
	//go to select's location
//modify css to hide big nav on small widths and show button and select
	//modify css to hide select and button on larger widths
//deal with selected options depending on current page
